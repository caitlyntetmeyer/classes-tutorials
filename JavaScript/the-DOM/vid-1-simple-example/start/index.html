<!-- 
DOM - Document Object Model - representation of a webpage that JS can use, just like a map is a representation of a city.
The DOM is changeable - as if by adding a street to a map, you could add a street to the city in real life.
Global scope - window object
The document is a property of the window object.

Basic tasks JS can do w/the DOM:
	Select elements
	Read or change (manipulate) elements
	Listen for user actions
	Respond to user events

Quiz:
	You can use the document object to select and control elements of the currently loaded webpage.
	The document object is a global object representing the HTML and content of a web page.
