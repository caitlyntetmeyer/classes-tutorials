Treehouse: How to Learn

Learn Like an Expert - 

	Identify areas of weakness and work to improve on those

	Identifying My Learning Weaknesses:
	-What are the main concepts/ideas/facts I just learned?
	-Can I explain them in my own words?
	-Can I relate them to things I already know?

	If you can't answer those questions, you've ID'ed a learning weakness. Don't continue to the next chapter, video or lesson.

	If you're not understanding:
	-Put it into action
	-Rewatch or re-read with purpose
	-Supplement what I learned with another source

	If you're still confused:
	-Seek advice from an expert or colleague
	-Go to Community in Treehouse and ask
	-See if there's a Slack or IRC channel
	-Don't give up!

Focus Your Mind, Improve Your Learning -

	Prepare your mind
		-Break your time into chunks of focus (1 hr) and diffuse (15 min.)

	Prepare your space

	Get started! Work on sth you've been putting off for just 5 minutes
