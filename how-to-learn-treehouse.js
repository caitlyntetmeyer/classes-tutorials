Treehouse: How to Learn

Learn Like an Expert - 

	Identify areas of weakness and work to improve on those

	Identifying My Learning Weaknesses:
	-What are the main concepts/ideas/facts I just learned?
	-Can I explain them in my own words?
	-Can I relate them to things I already know?

	If you can't answer those questions, you've ID'ed a learning weakness. Don't continue to the next chapter, video or lesson.

	If you're not understanding:
	-Put it into action
	-Rewatch or re-read with purpose
	-Supplement what I learned with another source

	If you're still confused:
	-Seek advice from an expert or colleague
	-Go to Community in Treehouse and ask
	-See if there's a Slack or IRC channel
	-Don't give up!

Focus Your Mind, Improve Your Learning -

	You need both focus and diffuse modes

	Prepare your body
		-Exercise clears toxins from our brain
		-Fuel your brain with healthy fats like eggs, nuts and avocado
		-Wait to have coffee til mid-morning

	Prepare your mind
		-Break your time into chunks of focus (1 hr) and diffuse (15 min.)

	Prepare your space
		-Close applications you don't need and turn off notifications
		-Wear headphones - listen to nature sounds or white noise

	Learn sth new before bed
	Get started! Work on sth you've been putting off for just 5 minutes

Ways to Build a Habit of Learning - 
	
	Spread your learning over the week - the more often, the better, but 3 times a week is good. 15-30 minutes a session is good, or an hour is great. 

Build a Learning Mindset -

	Fixed vs. Growth Mindset:

	A growth mindset sees effort as the key to success.
	Failure is just one step along the learning path.
	We can always grow our intelligence and learn new skills.
	You can exercise your brain to make it stronger!

	Learning is a process that requires effort.
	You'll need to study and practice to succeed.

	Ask yourself, "How can I improve?"
	Mistakes are part of learning.
	Learning takes time. You can't learn programming instantly.

Be a Lifelong Learner -

	Learning sth, even if it becomes obsolete, makes you a better developer.
	The more you learn, the more easily you'll see similarities between conepts.
	Treat your available learning time as a limited resource.
	Lifelong learning isn't a sprint; it's a marathon
