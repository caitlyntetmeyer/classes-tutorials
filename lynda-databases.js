What Are Databases?

They solve the problems of data storage (names, descriptions, amounts, files):
1. Size (ex: speed when you have 2 million entries)
2. Ease of updating (ex: 200 ppl need to update it at the same time)
3. Accuracy (ex: Nothing prevents typos in an Excel spreadsheet)
4. Security (ex: Anyone could edit an Excel sheet)
5. Redundancy (ex: The data itself shouldn't have multiple entries, esp. if they conflict)
6. Importance of your data

Db's give us STRUCTURE.

These are database MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (DBMS), not db's: Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, DB@, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS Access.
	You use DBMS's to create one or more databases.
	The databases are yours, and they follow your rules.
	Db's are generally represented as cylinders.

RDBMS - relational database management systems

NoSQL DBMS - MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra

Relational Db Mgmt Systems:

The most widely used
Use the same principles across all offerings
Are foundational for understanding other systems

---

RDMS Features:

A db has tables w/rows and columns.
Example of column names: LastName (text), HireDate (date), Grade (numeric), Salary (currency).

By defining columns, we're imposing rules on the data they store.
The DBMS won't let us break these rules.

Primary keys must be unique.
System-generated primary keys may be called synthetic keys or surrogate keys.
Most important key in a table.
