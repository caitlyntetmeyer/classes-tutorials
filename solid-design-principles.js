SOLID Design Principles:

SOLID is a set of design principles in object-oriented software development.

S - Single Responsibility Principle
O - Open/Closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion

Single Responsibility Principle:

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

Why follow this? It makes your software easier to implement and prevents unexpected side effects of future changes.

Classes, microservices, and software components that have only one responsibility are much easier to explain and understand. This reduces the number of bugs, improves your development speed, and makes your life as a software dev much easier.
