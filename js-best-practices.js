JavaScript Best Practices | Pluralsight

Why talk about best practices?
	JS has been a secondary language for many devs
	With the rise of Node and React Native, JS is now taking over
	JS is different than most other languages

Why take this course? 
	So you can work collaboratively.
	You can't believe everything you read online.
	Take knowledge with you.

Write code in a maintainable way!
